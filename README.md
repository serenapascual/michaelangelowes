# MichaelangeLowe's - Interior color visualizer :art:

`// TODO: Insert screenshots.`

## About
This Android app will digitally repaint an interior room's walls with the color of a user's choosing, given an image of a room.

"MichaelangeLowe's" is a [portmanteau]([url](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/portmanteau)) of [Michaelangelo]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo)), the famed Renaissance painter, and [Lowe's]([url](https://www.lowes.com/)), the American chain company retailing paint and other home improvement wares.

### Motivation
* I am a bit rusty on general Android app development and want to hone my skills.
* I'd like to gain some footing with technology new to me, primarily Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
* I'd like to repaint one of my bedroom's walls before I move in this month, but I'm having trouble deciding on a new color.
